## ..:: Chrome/Edge Skins by niivu ::..

Some simple skins to accompany some of my themes for Windows.  Works for Windows 10 or 11.  Supported browsers are Chrome and Edge.

## Chrome Fix for the titlebar and caption buttons.
Right click the taskbar or desktop shortcut of the browser > Right Click the browser name > Properties and after "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" in the "Target" field, add --disable-windows10-custom-titlebar at the end and click Apply. Should look something like this: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-windows10-custom-titlebar. Start your browser using the shortcut and the titlebar and caption buttons will now match the Windows theme.

## Installation instructions for skins

1. Launch Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Check the "Developer mode" checkbox at the top.
3. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and choose the desired theme directory.  

(To reset or remove the theme, visit `chrome://settings` and click "Reset to Default" in the "Appearance" section.)
