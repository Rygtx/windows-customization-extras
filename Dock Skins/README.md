## ..:: Dock Skins by niivu ::..

Dock backgrounds and indicators for most popular Windows dock programs.
Personally I use [Nexus Dock by Winstep](https://www.winstep.net/nexus.asp#:~:text=Nexus%20Ultimate%20is%20an%20enhanced,desktop%20enhancement%20products%20for%20Windows)).  There's free and paid versions of the program.  Refer to the sites documentation on how to set things up.
