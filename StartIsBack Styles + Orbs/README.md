## ..:: StartIsBack Styles + Orbs by niivu ::..

Start Menu, Taskbar skins and Start Orbs to be used with either [StartIsBack](https://www.startisback.com/) (windows 10) or [StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com/) (Windows 11).
The start orbs in Windows 11 are now in .svg format and resize automatically depending on your taskbar size and dpi settings.
For Windows 10 users you can use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free) to convert the .svg to .png according to the size required for your individual setup.  You can then use an image editor of your choosing to further customize.  Use the Windows 10 PNG Start orbs as a guide in converting them.  There's 3 states that will need to be created to represent NORMAL, HOVER and PRESSED.
